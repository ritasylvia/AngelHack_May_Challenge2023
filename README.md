Monthly Code Challenge for AngelHack
## Challenge1:

John was visiting a friend one day who lived in an apartment, but the instructions that he
received were a bit confusing. When he arrives, he starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and
has to follow the instructions one character at a time.
A left arrow (<) means going up one floor, and a right arrow (>) means going down one floor

Which floor did he end up on?
