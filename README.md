# AngelHack_May_Challenge2023
Monthly Code Challenge for AngelHack
# Challenge1:

John was visiting a friend one day who lived in an apartment, but the instructions that he
received were a bit confusing. When he arrives, he starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and
has to follow the instructions one character at a time.
A left arrow (<) means going up one floor, and a right arrow (>) means going down one floor

Which floor did he end up on?

## Solution:
#### Answer = 56

# Challenge2:
### Who’s the fastest runner? (1 mark)
A group of friends wanted to know who is the fastest amongst them, and
decided to hold a running race.
It wasn’t fun just running, so they decided to go for a marathon. These guys are good, but
must rest occasionally to recover their energy.
Did I mention that these people are weird? They can only be running (always at their top
speed), or resting (not moving at all), and can only spend integer amounts of time in either
state.
Example case:
John can run 10 m/s for 6 seconds, but then must rest for 20 seconds
James can run 8 m/s for 8 seconds, but then must rest for 25 seconds
 In this case, John would have won if the race ended at 100 seconds.
Here are the descriptions of this group of friends:
1) John can run 10 m/s for 6 seconds, but then must rest for 20 seconds
2) James can run 8 m/s for 8 seconds, but then must rest for 25 seconds
3) Jenna can run 12 m/s for 5 seconds, but then must rest for 16 seconds
4) Josh can run 7 m/s for 7 seconds, but then must rest for 23 seconds
5) Jacob can run 9 m/s for 4 seconds, but then must rest for 32 seconds
6) Jerry can run 5 m/s for 9 seconds, but then must rest for 18 seconds
After 1234 seconds, what is the distance of the winning runner?

##Solution:
#### Answer = Jenna: 3540m
